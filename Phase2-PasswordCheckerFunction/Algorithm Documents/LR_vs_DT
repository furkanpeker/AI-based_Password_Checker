A difference between Logistic Regression and Decision Tree algorithms is that you study with multiple independent variable (label / column) in DT, while LR estimates the realtionship between a dependent variable and one or more independent vairables according to the logical train data given as arguman!
LR is used to make a prediction about a categorical variable versus a continuous one. A categorical variable can be true or false, yes or no, 1 or 0, et cetera.
Another difference is that LR needs an adequate sample to represent values across all the response categories.
